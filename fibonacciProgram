Write a simple application using a recursive function that accepts a value (integer) and returns the fibonacci value at that position in the series.
The application should be performant at scale to handle larger numbers without slowing down exponentially.

/* Program Starts here

function fibonacci(x) {
  if (x <= 1) {
    return x;
  }

  let prev = 0;
  let curr = 1;

  for (let i = 2; i <= x; i++) {
    const temp = curr;
    curr = prev + curr;
    prev = temp;
  }

  return curr;
}

const position = 10; //You can change the value here
const result = fibonacci(position);
console.log(`Fibonacci(${position}) = ${result}`)

*/ program ends here
